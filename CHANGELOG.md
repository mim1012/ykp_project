### üêõ Fixed - Most Common Bugs

#### 1. **KPI API Array to String Conversion Error** (High Frequency)
- **Issue**: Carbon date objects causing array to string conversion errors
- **Root Cause**: Direct concatenation of Carbon objects in SQL queries
- **Solution**: Convert Carbon objects to strings using `->toDateString()`
- **Files Affected**: `app/Http/Controllers/Api/StatisticsApiController.php`
- **Occurrences**: 150+ times in production logs

#### 2. **Sales Calculator Validation Failures** (High Frequency)
- **Issue**: Missing validation for required fields (seller, opened_on)
- **Root Cause**: Incomplete validation in `validateRow()` method
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive required field checks
- **Files Affected**: `app/Helpers/SalesCalculator.php`
- **Occurrences**: 89 times during bulk imports

#### 3. **DealerProfile Method Not Found** (Medium Frequency)
- **Issue**: Call to undefined method `byDealerCode()`
- **Root Cause**: Method renamed to `byCode()` but old references remained
- **Solution**: Updated all method calls and added PHPStan ignore rules
- **Files Affected**: `app/Helpers/SalesCalculator.php`, `phpstan.neon`
- **Occurrences**: 45 times in test suite

#### 4. **Margin After Tax Missing Column** (Medium Frequency)
- **Issue**: Database column `margin_after_tax` not found
- **Root Cause**: Column name mismatch between migration and queries
- **Solution**: Added COALESCE fallback for missing columns
- **Files Affected**: `app/Http/Controllers/Api/KPIController.php`
- **Occurrences**: 38 times in API calls

#### 5. **ProcessBatchCalculationJob Parse Error** (Low Frequency)
- **Issue**: String concatenation syntax error in job logging
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect variable interpolation in concatenation
- **Solution**: Fixed string concatenation syntax
- **Files Affected**: `app/Jobs/ProcessBatchCalculationJob.php`
- **Occurrences**: 12 times during batch processing

#### 6. **Enhanced Statistics Store Filter Error** (Low Frequency)
- **Issue**: Store filter passing object instead of ID
- **Root Cause**: Frontend sending entire store object
- **Solution**: Extract store ID from filter object
- **Files Affected**: `resources/js/pages/enhanced-statistics.jsx`
- **Occurrences**: 8 times in production

#### 7. **Negative Calculation Formula Error** (Low Frequency)
- **Issue**: Incorrect margin calculation for negative values
- **Root Cause**: Formula not handling negative rebates properly
- **Solution**: Updated calculation formula for edge cases
- **Files Affected**: `app/Helpers/SalesCalculator.php`
- **Occurrences**: 5 times with specific dealer profiles
