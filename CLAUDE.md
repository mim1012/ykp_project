This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

YKP ERP Dashboard - A Laravel-based sales management system with React frontend, implementing role-based access control (RBAC) for headquarters, branches, and stores. The system features real-time sales calculations, bulk data entry via Excel-like interfaces, and comprehensive financial reporting.

## Architecture

### Backend Stack
- **Laravel 12** with PHP 8.2+
- **Filament v4** for admin panels
- **PostgreSQL** (production) / **SQLite** (testing)
- **Application Service Pattern** in `app/Application/Services/`
- **Job Queue System** for background processing

### Frontend Stack
- **Vite** build system with React integration
- **React 18** with hooks and context API
- **TailwindCSS v4** for styling
- **AG-Grid** for Excel-like bulk data entry
- **Chart.js** for data visualization
- **TanStack Query** for API state management

### Key Architectural Patterns
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Business logic in Application Services
- **RBAC System**: Role-based middleware (headquarters/branch/store)
- **API-First Design**: RESTful APIs with consistent response format
- **Feature Flags**: Environment-based feature toggling
- **Real-time Calculations**: SalesCalculator helper for margin calculations

## Development Commands

### Quick Start
```bash
# Full development environment (recommended)
composer dev                    # Runs PHP server + queue worker + Vite concurrently
composer dev-with-logs          # Same as above + Laravel Pail for logs

# Individual services
php artisan serve               # Laravel dev server
php artisan queue:listen        # Queue worker
npm run dev                     # Vite dev server
```

### Testing
```bash
# Backend tests
composer test                   # Run all PHPUnit tests
composer quality                # Full quality check (format + analyze + test)
./vendor/bin/phpunit --filter="TestClassName"  # Run specific test class
./vendor/bin/phpunit --filter="testMethodName" # Run specific test method

# Frontend E2E tests
npm run test:smoke              # Quick smoke tests for deployment
npx playwright test             # Full Playwright suite
npx playwright test --headed    # With browser UI
npx playwright test tests/playwright/specific-test.spec.js  # Run specific test file
```

### Code Quality
```bash
composer format                 # Fix code style with Laravel Pint
composer format-check          # Check style without changes
composer analyse               # Run PHPStan static analysis
./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --level=max app/Helpers/SalesCalculator.php  # Analyze specific file
./vendor/bin/pint app/         # Format specific directory
```

### Database Management
```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh      # Reset database (dev only)
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed  # Reset with seeders
php artisan db:seed            # Run seeders only
php artisan migrate            # Run pending migrations
php artisan migrate:rollback   # Rollback last migration batch
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
npm run predeploy              # Build assets + cache config/routes/views
npm run build                  # Production build only
php artisan config:cache       # Cache configuration
php artisan route:cache        # Cache routes
php artisan view:cache         # Cache views
```

## Database Schema

### Core Tables
- **users**: System users with role-based access
- **branches**: Regional management units
- **stores**: Individual retail locations
- **sales**: Transaction records with calculated margins
- **monthly_settlements**: Month-end financial reconciliation
- **dealer_profiles**: Calculation configurations per dealer

### Key Relationships
```
Users → Branches (many-to-one)
Users → Stores (many-to-one)
Stores → Branches (many-to-one)
Sales → Stores (many-to-one)
Sales → DealerProfiles (for calculations)
MonthlySettlements → Sales (aggregates by period)
```

## API Architecture

### Authentication
- Session-based authentication for web routes
- CSRF protection enabled for state-changing operations
- RBAC middleware enforces role-based access

### API Response Format
```php
// Success response
['success' => true, 'data' => mixed, 'meta' => array]

// Error response
['success' => false, 'error' => string, 'code' => int]
```

### Key API Endpoints
```
GET  /api/dashboard/overview         # Dashboard statistics
POST /api/sales/bulk-save           # Bulk sales import
POST /api/calculation/profile/row   # Real-time margin calculation
GET  /api/monthly-settlements       # Financial reconciliation
GET  /api/statistics/sales          # Sales statistics with filters
POST /api/users                     # User management (HQ only)
```

## Sales Calculation Engine

Located in `app/Helpers/SalesCalculator.php`:
- Implements Excel-like calculation formulas
- Real-time margin calculations based on dealer profiles
- Handles both basic and profile-based calculations
- Tax rate: 10% (constant: TAX_RATE)
- Key calculations: total_rebate, settlement, tax, margin_before, margin_after

### Calculation Fields Mapping
```php
// Input fields (supports multiple naming conventions)
price_setting/base_price     → K (액면가/셋팅가)
verbal1                      → L (구두1)
verbal2                      → M (구두2)
grade_amount                 → N (그레이드)
addon_amount/additional_amount → O (부가추가)
paper_cash/cash_activation   → P (서류상현금개통)
usim_fee                     → Q (유심비)
new_mnp_disc/new_mnp_discount → R (신규/MNP할인)
deduction                    → S (차감)
cash_in/cash_received        → W (현금받음)
payback                      → X (페이백)

// Calculated fields
total_rebate = K+L+M+N+O     → T (리베총계)
settlement = T-P+Q+R+S       → U (정산금)
tax = U × 0.10               → V (세금)
margin_before = U-V+W+X      → Y (세전마진)
margin_after = V+Y           → Z (세후마진)
```

## Role-Based Features

### Headquarters (role: headquarters)
- Full system access including user management
- Cross-branch reporting and analytics
- Dealer profile management
- System-wide statistics and reports

### Branch (role: branch)
- Branch-specific data access only
- Store management within their branch
- Branch-level reporting and analytics
- Cannot access other branches' data

### Store (role: store)
- Store-specific sales input only
- Basic reporting for their store
- No access to branch or HQ features
- Limited to their own sales data

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (`tests/Unit/`)
Focus on business logic, especially:
- SalesCalculator computations
- DealerProfile calculations
- User permission checks

### Feature Tests (`tests/Feature/`)
API endpoint testing:
- Authentication and authorization
- RBAC enforcement
- Sales data CRUD operations
- Statistics API responses

### E2E Tests (`tests/playwright/`)
Complete user workflows:
- Role-based login scenarios
- Sales data entry via AG-Grid
- Report generation
- Cross-role data isolation

## Performance Optimizations

### Database
- Indexes on: store_id, sale_date, agency, branch_id
- Aggregate queries to avoid N+1 problems
- Query result caching for dashboard stats

### Frontend
- Code splitting via Vite for optimal chunks
- Virtual scrolling in AG-Grid for large datasets
- TanStack Query caching with 5-minute stale time
- Lazy loading for images and heavy components

### API
- Rate limiting on calculation endpoints (60/minute)
- Background jobs for bulk operations > 100 rows
- Response caching for statistics (5-minute TTL)

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```env
# Database
DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=ykp_dashboard

```

## Important Development Guidelines

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Supabase Backup Before Migrations - 필수!
**모든 마이그레이션 작업 전에 반드시 Supabase 백업을 수행하세요:**

#### 백업 절차 (마이그레이션 전 필수)
1. **Supabase 대시보드 접속**: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. **프로젝트 선택**: YKP Dashboard 프로젝트
3. **Database → Backups 메뉴 선택**
4. **"Create backup" 또는 "Download backup" 클릭**
5. **백업 파일 다운로드 및 안전한 위치에 저장**
6. **백업 완료 후에만 마이그레이션 실행**

#### 백업 파일 명명 규칙
```
db_cluster-YYYY-MM-DD@HH-MM-SS.backup
예: db_cluster-2025-09-29@17-09-30.backup
```

### ⚠️ Database Migration Rules - 중요!
**절대 기존 데이터를 삭제하지 마세요:**
- ❌ `php artisan migrate:fresh` **사용 금지** - 모든 데이터가 삭제됩니다
- ❌ `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed` **사용 금지** - 데이터베이스가 초기화됩니다
- ✅ `php artisan migrate` - 새로운 마이그레이션만 실행
- ✅ `php artisan migrate:rollback` - 마지막 마이그레이션만 롤백
- 스키마 변경 시 ALTER TABLE 사용 (DROP TABLE 금지)
- 🚨 **Supabase 프로덕션 환경에서는 위 백업 절차 완료 후에만 마이그레이션 실행**

### 📍 Local Testing Information
**로컬 테스트 환경 접속 정보:**
- **Laravel 서버**: http://127.0.0.1:8000 또는 http://localhost:8000
- **서버 시작**: `php artisan serve` (기본 포트 8000)
- **Vite 개발 서버**: `npm run dev` (포트 5173, HMR 지원)
- **동시 실행**: `composer dev` (Laravel + Vite 함께 실행)

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding a New Sales Field
1. Add migration for database column
2. Update `SalesCalculator::computeRow()` mapping
3. Add field to AG-Grid column definitions
4. Update API validation rules in `SalesApiController`
5. Add to test fixtures in `tests/`

### Creating a New Role-Based Feature
1. Define permission in `RoleMiddleware`
2. Add route with appropriate middleware
3. Update frontend route guards
4. Add E2E tests for all roles

### Debugging Calculation Issues
